# MyJsonParser

A simple and efficient JSON parsing library to handle JSON data in your application. This repository provides utilities to parse, validate, and manipulate JSON objects in a straightforward and easy-to-use way.

## Features

- Parse JSON strings into usable data structures (objects/arrays).
- Handle syntax errors and invalid JSON gracefully.
- Support for accessing and manipulating nested JSON data.
- Lightweight and simple API.

## Installation

To use this library, you can download it. It is definetly not better than the already made JsonParsers, but hey, if you find issues in it feel free to create one for me and I will work on it!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karimhaddad32/MyJsonParser.git
```
